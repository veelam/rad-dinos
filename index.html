                  Ankylosaurus was a tank-like, plant-eating dinosaur - its entire top side was heavily protected from carnivores with thick, 
                  oval plates embedded (fused) in its leathery skin, 2 rows of spikes along its body, large horns that projected 
                  from the back of the head, and a club-like tail. It even had bony plates as protection for its eyes. 
                  Only its under-belly was unplated. Among its contemporaries were the large meat-eating Tyrannosaurus, 
                  Tarbosaurus, and Deinonychus. Short of being flipped over, the Ankylosaurus was well protected from 
                  these predators, and could even defend itself with its club-like tail.

                  Brachiosaurus is known to be one of the largest, heaviest, and tallest of the dinosaurs. Its distinctive
                  features include a giraffe-like neck, short tail, and nostrils above its eyes. Its head was considerably 
                  smaller than the rest of its gigantic body. It may have used its tail and elongated neck for display purposes, defense, 
                  and fighting. Brachiosaurus walked on all fours and had front legs that were stronger than its rear legs. 
                  Since the front legs were stronger, the body sloped downward. Brachiosaurus' long neck allowed it to 
                  forage on the tops of trees. It did not chew its food, but used its jaws to collect food, which the tongue 
                  pushed down into the throat.

                  Deinonychus was a carnivorous, or meat-eating, dinosaur that inhabited North America during 
                  the early Cretaceous period, approximately 98 to 144 million years ago. Deinonychus is classified 
                  in the family Dromaeosauridae, which contains some of the most fearsome predators of the Cretaceous period. 
                  The Dromaeosauridae belong to the order Saurischia (the lizard-hipped dinosaurs) and the suborder Theropoda.
                  As a predator, Deinonychus was built for the chase and the kill. Its body was strong and light, with
                  large sicklelike talons that measured 13cm long on the second toe of each foot. Deinonychus had a 
                  large brain, which enabled it to perform complex chase and kill movements.

                  Hypsilophodon had a beak made of horn, cheek pouches and 28-30 self-sharpening cheek teeth in a small 
                  skull 4 3/4 inches (12 cm) long, by 2 inches (5 cm) wide. Hypsilophodon may have had 2 rows of bony plates 
                  running down its back. Slender legs and a stiffened tail gave it speed and agility. It had large eyes, 
                  strong jaws, five-fingered hands and four-toed feet (one toe on each foot had a hind claw).
                  Small and fast, this herbivore had rear legs much longer than the front legs, self-sharpening 
                  cheek teeth to nip off vegetation, and cheek pouches for storing food.

                  Iguanodon was the largest, best known, and most widespread of all the iguanodontids, which 
                  are closely related to the hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs. A massive herbivore, the 
                  animal probably spent its time grazing while moving about on four legs, although it was 
                  able to walk on two. Iguanodontid forelimbs had an unusual five-fingered hand: the wrist 
                  bones were fused into a block; the joints of the thumb were fused into a conelike spike; 
                  the three middle fingers ended in blunt, hooflike claws; and the fifth finger diverged 
                  laterally from the others. The teeth were ridged and formed 
                  sloping surfaces whose grinding action could pulverize its diet of low-growing ferns and
                  horsetails.

                  Pteranodon was a flying reptile who had a wingspan of 23 feet long or more. Pteranodon's large size 
                  was probably the why it most likely soared than beat its wings. Although the limbs appear robust, 
                  the bones were completely hollow, and their walls were no thicker than about one millimetre. 
                  The shape of the bones, however, made them resistant to the aerodynamic forces of flight. Its 
                  toothless jaws were very long and pelican-like. The design of Pteranodon's jaws and discovery of 
                  fossilized fish bones and scales alongside Pteranodon specimens suggest a diet of fish.

                  Spinosaurus, or "spined reptile" was named for its "sail-back" feature, created
                  by tall vertebral spines. Longer and heavier than Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus 
                  is the largest known carnivorous dinosaur. The sail over the animal's back 
                  was probably used for social displays or species recognition rather than for 
                  temperature regulation. Some authorities maintain that the sail was actually 
                  a hump used to store water and lipids. Like other spinosaurids, Spinosaurus 
                  possessed a long, narrow skull resembling that of a crocodile and nostrils 
                  near the eyes instead of the end of the snout. Its teeth were straight and 
                  conical instead of curved and bladelike as in other theropods.

                  >Pachycephalosaurus was a biped with strong hind limbs and much less developed
                  forelimbs. Its high, domelike skull was formed by a thick mass of solid bone 
                  grown over the tiny brain. Its large head could reach 2 
                  feet in length. The massive, solid bone dome on top of its head was 10 inches 
                  (25 centimeters) thick. This dome was surrounded by bony knobs and spikes, 
                  making Pachycephalosaurus look as if it were wearing a crown. It also had 
                  spikes running down its snout. It has been suggested that these animals were head 
                  butters like living rams, but the confirmation of the domes says otherwise. 
                  Flank-butting remains a possibility, but a more likely function in most was 
                  species recognition or display.
